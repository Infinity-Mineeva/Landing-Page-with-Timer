Introduction
---
This is a fully responsive Startup Landing page where people can sign up to receive update emails about an soon-to-be-launched Startup company. The Landing Page has a timer counting down to the launch of the mysterious company in question (the date it's counting down to, July 1st, is my personal deadline for completing the "Become a Front Developer" Career Path on the Zero-to-Mastery website).


This project is from the "Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery" course on the [Zero-to-Mastery website](https://zerotomastery.io/).

Methodology
---

This largely remained unchanged [from its predecessor](https://github.com/Infinity-Mineeva/Startup-Landing-Page) in terms of how the page works. The only addition I made was a timer counting down to a specific date. I remembered doing an exercise on w3schools for how to create a simple countdown timer. I dug up my old notes and incorporated the code into this, tweaking as needed.

Tools I Used
---
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* Mailchimp

<br>

What I learned
---
It was certainly a refresher, particularly with the `setInterval()` method and calculating times. Also, trying to remember the `position` property, its values, and which one I needed to use in my css.

<br>

Items for further study
---
I'm still interested in learning more about Bootstrap to satisfy my own curiousity if nothing else. It's been awhile since I've visited w3schools, and I've noticed that they have a Bootstrap Tutorial Section. I'm considering going through that when I have some spare time.
